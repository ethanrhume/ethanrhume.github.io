      <h2>Hey there!</h2>
      <p>Feel free to poke around and see what I'm working on. My current interests are centered around environmental justice
        and climate change. This coming year, I'll be finishing up my Master's in Health Services at the Univeristy of 
        Washington. Afterwards, I hope to continue promoting a clean environment and equitable health outcomes through 
        data-driven storytelling. This site is designed to serve primarily as a professional portfolio, as well as a way to 
        keep friends and family updated on my latest work. Please don't hesitate to reach out and start a conversation!
