      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Walla Walla County has experienced the highest enteric disease burden by county
        in Washington State for several consecutive years. Enteric diseases (or 
        gastrointestinal illnesses) are typically notifiable conditions due to their 
        relatively high virulence. Although surveillance is in place for these conditions, 
        the County has historically lacked the resources to dive deeply into this data 
        in-house. This has limited the ability to design effective popilation health 
        initiatives, which benefit from rich longitudinal data analysis.</p>

      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic motivated an expansion for the Walla Walla County Department 
        of Community Health (WWCDCH) epidemiology staff, which has since allowed for 
        ongoing monitoring and trend analysis for notifiable conditions. These notifiable 
        conditions include but are not limited to enteric diseases. Since 2022, WWCDCH 
        staff have produced annual reports on all notifiable conditions which are used
        to guide health promotion campaigns in the County. However, a backlog of data still
        exists from the past 10+ years.</p>

      <p>This project was motivated by a desire to compile a historical database 
        of existing data from 2013 to 2023, and retrospectively extend contemporary 
        analyses. In doing so, we hoped to better understand the direction of trends 
        pre- and post-pandemic, and inform future public health interventions.</p>
      
      <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>

      <p>Much thanks to the epidemiology staff at Walla Walla County Department of 
        Community Health for supplying the data and oversight for this project. Thank 
        you to the UW Student Epidemic Action Leaders program for making this work 
        possible.</p>
