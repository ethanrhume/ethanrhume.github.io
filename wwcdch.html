      <p><i>This project was undertaken as a collaboration between the UW Student Epidemic 
        Action Leaders Program and the Walla Walla County Department of Community Health.
        Although still under construction, expect a full report below in the coming month.
        In the meantime, head over to the <a href="https://github.com/ethanrhume/wwcdch">

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>Walla Walla County has experienced the highest enteric disease burden by county
      in Washington State for several consecutive years. Enteric diseases (or 
      gastrointestinal illnesses) are typically notifiable conditions due to their 
      relatively high virulence. Although surveillance is in place for these conditions, 
      the County has historically lacked the resources to dive deeply into this data 
      in-house.</p>

      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic motivated an expansion for the Walla Walla County Department 
      of Community Health (WWCDCH) epidemiology staff, which has since allowed for 
      ongoing monitoring and trend analysis for notifiable conditions. These notifiable 
      conditions include but are not limited to enteric diseases. Since 2022, WWCDCH 
      staff have produced annual reports on all notifiable conditions which are used
      to guide health promotion campaigns in the County.</p>

      <p>The  project was motivated by a desire to compile a historical database 
      of existing data from 2013 to 2023, and retrospectively extend these analyses. In 
      doing so, we hoped to better understand the direction of trends pre- and 
      post-pandemic, and inform future public health interventions.</p>
