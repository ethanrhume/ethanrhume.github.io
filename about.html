      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/headshot.jpeg" alt="Ethan Hume" class="about-photo"/>
      <p>I am a second-year Master's student in Health Services at the University of 
        Washington. The M.S. Health Services program is designed to build a strong skill 
        set in research methodology and analytics, with the end goal of addressing 
        population health issues through program implementation and policy change. I 
        center my own work around the human impacts of anthropogenic climate change, 
        disasters, and the resultant health disparities. As our planet continues to 
        heat up and environmental hazards become more difficult to predict, we are all 
        responsible for stepping up to the plate and promoting rapid adaptation and 
        resilience.</p>

      <p>As a "storyteller" at heart, I believe I have an important role to play in this 
        work. By communicating my own and others' research findings in compelling and 
        accessible ways, I aim to drive engagement amongst the public as well as 
        policymakers and be a catalyst for decisive action.</p>

      <p>My background in healthcare helped me arrive where I am today. I worked as an
        EMT in New Orleans, Lousiana for several years. During that time, I treated 
        patients through multiple hurricanes, a tornado, and the Covid pandemic. I saw 
        the way these disasters combined with existing socioeconomic injustices to 
        exacerbate health disparities. On moving back home to Seattle, I began to work 
        in the Medicaid space as a community health worker. I helped patients navigate 
        homelessness and chronic health conditions during extreme heat events and 
        winter storms, often with no wider system in place to assist. It's these 
        experiences and more which motivate my interest in environmental justice and 
        policy work.</p>

      <p>Head over to the <b><a href = "projects.html">Projects</a></b> gallery to 
        further explore some of my work. Of course, don't hesitate to reach out and 
        start a conversation at my <b><a href = mailto:erhume@uw.edu">email</a></b> as 
        well!</p>

      <h2>Outside of Work</h2>
      <p>I live in Seattle, WA with my partner and our Malinois / Shar-Pei mix, Tex. We 
        spend much of our free time backpacking and camping throughout the PNW. Closer to
        home, I enjoy cooking and playing videogames. When the weather is favorable, I'll
        often do some amateur mushroom foraging as well as growing some culinary fungi at
        home.</p>

       <p>Despite my student budget, I'm passionate about travel and try to make at least 
        one international trip each year. Most recently, we've spent some time in Greece
        as well as Aotearoa/New Zealand, with a potential trip planned to Portugal in 2026. 
        In the future, I'll be keeping the <a href = "blog.html"><b>Blog</b></a> updated
        with my latest adventures, so definitely check that out!</p>
