      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <img src="images/headshot.jpeg" alt="Ethan Hume" class="about-photo"/>
      <p>I am a second-year Master's student in Health Services at the University of 
        Washington. The M.S. Health Services program focuses on building a strong skill 
        set in research methodology and analytics, with the end goal of addressing 
        population health issues through program implementation and policy change. A 
        core philosophy is the importance of evidence-driven decision-making in public 
        health and beyond. I center my own work around the human impacts of 
        anthropogenic climate change, disasters, and resultant disparities. As our planet
        continues to heat up and environmental hazards become more difficult to predict,
        we all are responsible for stepping up to the plate and promoting rapid 
        adaptation and resilience.</p>

      <p>As a "storyteller" at heart, I believe I have an important role to play in this 
        work. By communicating my own and others' research findings in compelling and 
        accessible ways, I can drive engagement amongst the public as well as policymakers
        and be a catalyst for decisive action.</p>

      <p>My background in healthcare helped me arrive where I am today. I worked as an
        EMT in New Orleans, Lousiana for several years. During that time, I treated 
        patients through multiple hurricanes, a tornado, and the Covid pandemic. I saw 
        the way these disasters combined with existing socioeconomic injustices to 
        exacerbate health disparities. On moving back home to Seattle, I began to work 
        in the Medicaid space as a community health worker. I helped patients navigate 
        homelessness and chronic health conditions during extreme heat events and 
        winter storms, often with no wider system in place to assist. It's these 
        experiences and more which motivate my interest in environmental justice and 
        policy work.</p>

      <p>Included below are highlights from my CV, or head over to the 
        <b><a href = "projects.html">Projects</a></b> gallery to further explore some 
        of my work. Of course, don't hesitate to reach out and chat at my
