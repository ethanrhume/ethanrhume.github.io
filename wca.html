        <p>This project is still under construction. Expect a full report below in the 
          coming months. In the meantime, head over to the

      <h3>Description</h3>
      <p>The greater Yakima region experiences a significantly increased level of fine 
        particulate matter (PM2.5) pollution as compared to other areas in Washington 
        [CITE], which is linked to elevated incidence of lung disease and all-cause 
        mortality [CITE]. Wildfire smoke is a primary driver of PM2.5 pollution in the 
        region [CITE] and must be mitigated to improve health outcomes for this 
        population.</p>

      <p>In 2021, the Washington Legislature passed the Climate Commitment Act (CCA), 
        which directed the Department of Ecology to define communities which are 
        overburdened by criteria air pollutants. Through this process, sixteen 
        communities were identified including three surrounding Yakima: East Yakima, 
        Lower Yakima Valley, and Moxee Valley.</p>

      <p>This project aims to describe the outsized burden of air pollution, from all 
        sources as well as from wildfires specifically, in Yakima county. I then identify
        and evaluate potential policy items to alleviate the burden in this region. I 
        conducted this analysis in partnership with staff from Washington Conservation
        Action (WCA), a non-profit conservation oriented policy group in WA state.</p>

      <h3>Acknowledgements</h3>
      <p>Much thanks to the team at Washington Conservation Action for guiding this work
        and providing mentorship and oversight. Thank you also to the various faculty 
        at the University of Washington Department of Health Systems & Population Health
        who lent their advice and expertise through this process.</p>
